# Practical work of algorithms
### This work is done with a classmate

Objective: learn about algorithms and how to implement them.
The prompt is to choose 3 of the following algorithms and implement them to solve a problem
- Breadth-first Search algorithm
- Depth-first Search algorithm
- Prim algorithm
- Kruskal algorithm
- Dijkstra algorithm
- Floyd algorithm

Chosen algorithms:
- Prim algorithm
- Kruskal algorithm
- Dijkstra algorithm

We choose cities of our country to use them like a graph to implement the algorithms.
